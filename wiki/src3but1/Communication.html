        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          During our team’s preliminary research into the project, we realized
          that while the moving parts would largely utilize principles of
          synthetic biology, the application of our project had implications
          branching from public health to even climate change. Whilst doing
          this, the team realized that reaching out into the community and
          explaining a complex scientific topic in easily digestible and
          relatable terms could not only increase the awareness of our issue but
          also spark an interest in science for those who previously felt it too
          dense.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>Determining our Target Audience</h3>
        <p>
          As such, we realized that we could have the greatest impact in science
          communication and inspiring others by focusing on a younger audience,
          such as high school students. We decided to seek out high school
          students over other cohorts, such as elementary school students,
          because we felt that the students having taken introductory biology
          already would be better able to digest the material of our project
          without risk of alienation. <br><br>
          Once we determined what we wanted to do, the team discussed the best
          delivery methods of information in order to engage students at the
          highest level. We recognized that with restrictions still in place in
          many areas to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 that the likelihood
          of working with students in-person was a low possibility, especially
          during our time frame in the summer. After searching for opportunities
          to interact with high-school students in some form during the summer,
          we discovered the University of Florida’s Research Immersion in
          Science and Engineering (RISE) program. This program featured high
          achieving 10th grade students in the United States interested in
          accelerated scientific research and learning, lasting for 2 weeks
          virtually during the summer. The team determined that this group of
          students would not only be a perfect fit for our target demographic,
          but that their interest in the camp would suggest they have some
          existing interest in science research.

        <p>
          After reaching out to the program sponsor, UF’s Center for
          Precollegiate Education and Training, we were put into contact with
          <strong>Dr. Julie Bokor</strong>, the RISE program lead. <br><br>
          It was during this meeting that we learned the program was being
          delivered solely through the virtual Zoom platform, and that there was
          no in-person component to the program. Despite this serving as a
          potential obstacle for reaching our goal of creating an interactive
          presentation to inform and entertain a young audience, we persevered
          nonetheless. Dr. Bokor had indicated that she may have either a 1 or 2
          hour time slot available for us, to let us know as we were closer to
          the presentation date. Nonetheless, we planned on preparing at least 2
          hours of content to accommodate for this possibility.
          <br><br>
          Given Dr. Bokor’s expertise in the field of education and science
          communication, we also decided to utilize our meeting time with her to
          brainstorm ideas on how to construct and deliver our presentation and
          seek advice on how to maintain a balance between entertaining and
          informing our audience. She provided a wide array of helpful
          suggestions that we considered and ended up pursuing for our
          presentation.
          <br><br>
          After our meeting with Dr. Bokor and subsequent meetings with the rest
          of our iGEM team, we planned on incorporating the following for a
          2-hour presentation:

            <li>A PowerPoint presentation</li>
            <li>An interactive infographic competition</li>
            <li>A tour of our iGEM lab</li>

          padding-left: 10%;
          padding-right: 10%;
          padding-top: 2.5%;
          padding-bottom: 2.5%;

          <div class="container">
            <p>
              As a team, we collectively decided that a PowerPoint presentation
              would be the most effective and efficient vehicle for delivering
              information pertaining to the science behind our project. Since we
              also assumed that most students in the audience would not know
              what iGEM is, we decided to also use the presentation as an
              opportunity to introduce the competition to the students. We thus
              decided on the appropriate structure for our presentation:
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="container">
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
              <li>Part 1: Introduction of iGEM and the UF iGEM team</li>
              <li>
                Part 2: Our Project: The problem, context behind it and our
                goals
              </li>
              <li>
                Part 3: Our Project: The Science behind our procedure and goals

              <li>Part 4: Tools & Skills we Employ in the Lab</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <p>
          Following the presentation, we planned on introducing an
          <strong>infographic</strong> competition to the students, leaving in
          some time for them to complete it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div
        class="container"
        style="
          text-align: center;
          padding-left: 20%;
          padding-right: 20%;
          padding-bottom: 2.5%;
        "
      >
        <p
          class="shadow"
          style="
            background-color: white;
            padding-left: 10%;
            padding-right: 10%;

            padding-bottom: 5%;
            border-radius: 10px;
          "
        >
          Our plan for an infographic competition involved having the students
          create a quick infographic about their favorite part of our
          presentation. The students would be invited to use a variety of
          different tools and softwares to design this infographic and would
          send it to our email. We would give them about 15 minutes to create
          the best work they can. Our “top picks” would be featured on our Team
          Instagram, and the students would be credited on our wiki page.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <p>
          Following the infographic competition and the small time window we
          give the students to complete this competition, we would enter the
          final phase of our presentation, a tour of the lab we use for our
          work. This was a suggestion from Dr. Bokor, which we thought would
          help excite the students to see what kind of exciting research exists
          in the next stages of their education. Although we were still not
          certain on the date or time slot for the presentation, we were aware
          that it would be sometime between 12 PM and 3 PM, which was also a
          good time for us to tour around the lab. Specifically, we planned on
          showing the students the layout of the lab, followed by all of the
          equipment and plates that we used in our experiments.
          <br><br>
          As we arrived closer to the presentation date, Dr. Bokor informed us
          that we were only given a one hour slot to present. We then had to
          decide what to remove from our 2 hour presentation, keeping in mind
          that we wanted to maximize both the information and entertainment
          factors of our presentation. We decided to keep the PowerPoint
          presentation component of the presentation and shorten the infographic
          competition at the end in order to maximize the information aspects of
          the presentation, which we believed were the biggest components of our
          partnership with RISE.
          <br><br>
          When our presentation day came, our content filled in the entire hour
          slot. We introduced the iGEM foundation, the iGEM competition, and
          this year’s team members for UF iGEM. Following this, we introduced
          our project and provided important contextual information to ensure
          every student could understand the premise of our project. When we
          began explaining the science behind our project, we made sure to
          simplify and condense the information, keeping in mind that some of
          our students had only taken biology at a high school level; therefore,
          they had little exposure to principles of genetics, microbiology and
          synthetic biology in general. We closed our presentation by explaining
          some important and relevant procedures that we perform in the lab,
          keeping in mind that these are procedures the students themselves may
          perform in the future.
